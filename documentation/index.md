# Gigya Module

## Description

The Gigya service supports a wide range of social login, sharing and community features throughout your site.

Note that your application must have a unique Gigya API key. To retrieve this key, go to the Site Dashboard page on Gigya's website. Follow the instructions in Gigya's Setup guide to setup your application and obtain a Gigya API-Key.

**Important**: please make sure to check the Enable Mobile or Desktop Client Applications API Access checkbox under the 'Advanced' section in the Site Settings page.
 
After you have retrieved you application's API key, store it in the _Gigya.apiKey_ property.
